Project - Arcade Game Clone

Name: Diego Gonzalez

This project is part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer nanodegree program.

By opening the Index file, you should be able to open up a game in which the keyboard's arrow keys control movement of the main character.
Use the arrow keys to get to the water, and avoid colliding with any bugs.
